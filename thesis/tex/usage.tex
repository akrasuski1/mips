Since we wanted our library to be acceessible to a wider public, we have prepared
a set of tools to help users apply our algorithms in real world settings. More specifically,
we have focused on three main aspects: creating bindings to a high-level programming language,
plugging our algorithms to popular tools like scikit-learn, and providing a set
of examples of how our code can be used.

We have decided to prepare bindings to a Python language. To do this, we used
the previously mentioned \texttt{pybind11} library. These bindings expose the core methods that
each of our algorithms expose, namely \texttt{train(...), add(...)} and \texttt{search(...)}.
We note however that it is trivial to expand those bindings to also expose internal
structs and methods of each class.

When it comes to using these bindings in real-world settings, we have prepared examples
in two major machine learning frameworks available in Python --- PyTorch
and scikit-learn.

In scikit-learn all linear classifiers, regardless of the way they are trained
or loss they minimize, inherit from a single base class --- \texttt{LinearClassifierMixin}.
It was therefore enough to provide our own implementation of this mixin. This implementation
only differs in behaviour at prediction time --- it first trains an internal index on the
weight matrix, and then uses it to efficiently return top-$k$ highest rank classes.

In PyTorch we provide an implementation of a \texttt{ApproximateLinear} layer.
At train time this layer falls back to standard PyTorch implementation, meaning
it can utilize the GPU acceleration. However, when prediction mode is enabled, we first
automatically train the index on the layer's weight matrix, and then provide a user with
a choice --- one can either use the layer as a standard \texttt{Linear}, or use it
to retrieve approximate top-$k$ output values.

We also provide a patch that adds our index to fastText, a popular tool for text classification.
We have used this model to perform experiments on Wiki-LSHTC and Amazon-3M datasets.
Since fastText is a command-line only utility, we have added \texttt{train-index}
and \texttt{approximate}-\texttt{predict} options available to users.
