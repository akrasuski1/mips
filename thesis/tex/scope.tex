The aim of this thesis is to write a software library which can be used in fast classification in problems where the number of classes is very large.
Algorithms belonging to the library are going to work like an index allowing to query a small number of linear classification models for a given test example (query).
The problem is often called maximum inner product search (MIPS).
After the algorithms were implemented, they were verified for correctness and their performance was tested.
